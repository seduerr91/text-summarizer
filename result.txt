Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a persons life. A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a persons life. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subjects life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subjects personality. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a persons experience of these life events. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the genre known as biography
